# Jonas release*

## **what is a "Jonas"?**

Jonas is a discord bot that I'm actively developing!

Right now he is 1 file consisting of around 250 lines of python.

He currently resides on a raspberry pi in the hands of a Acrid plushie.

So, if you have any cool ideas like "i wish hazel could do that" ping me ill try to implement it.

## **how is a "Jonas"?**

Right now Jonas has 2 main commands which, I am open to renaming because I want to rp with him and I dont know how *connacional* "!engrep" is.

* !ENGREP - imputs a .ship file and returns a .stl file
* !RESIZE - imputs a .png file and returns a .png than can be used for banners
  
Further down line I want to make a !LINER command that you can use to build your liner shape (same with clns).

## **where is a "Jonas"?**

Hopefully right here!

@avil how can I get my bot in [this server?](https://discord.com/invite/nebulousfc)

As of 1 line ago I have started the process of getting him in [this very server!](https://discord.com/invite/nebulousfc)

## **who can a "Jonas"?**

You can a Jonas!

With [this link](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1248318521302192158) you can invite Jonas to any server you are admin in.

If you are @tartiflette @colepercy120 @gwyvern  @maximilianarchambault @zopto (and many more!) and you want people to be able to 3d print your ships send me your files.

In order for a .stl to slice properly it needs to have absolutely no surfaces overlapping I would really appreciate it if you did this for me.

But, if you dont that's ok! 

After working through all the base game assets ive found a work flow and I can just grind it out.


## **why is a "Jonas"?**

ok so this is a story about feature creep let me walk through how i got here 
* i want to make a keystone laser pointer
* only files i can find are the ans hulls that dragon posted like a year ago
* "fine ill do it myself" *rips game files*
* see someone ask "are the 3d modles posted somewhere"
* ok i should make a repository containing not just my keystone but all assets
* it was around here i realized that i needed to manually fix all the assets in order to print them properly 
* im ranting about all the work im going to have to do to a friend and he says "probably insane project but the coolest thing ever would be a program that imports your ship build save and generates the appropriate model with all turrets n whatnot"
* ping @shadowlotus is this even posible "pretty sure it is."
* today

So about the * in the title...
Hes not entirely done.
All the infrastructure like the code and the pi are all set but I still have to grind through all the base game assets.
